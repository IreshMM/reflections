How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

We could see what has changed from the working state to the state where the bug
had been introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

We can don't need save each and every version of each file manually. So that
saves a lot of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

When manually choosing when to commit, since we are humans we can cleary
indentify logical changes and commit each separately, but if that happens
automatically it is more likely to happen in given time intervals which would
not represent logical changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because most projects have more than one file that interrelates. So at any given
point in time, snapshot of all the files is required represent a logical change
to the project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

We can use git log to see the history of commits along with their ids. So we can
use those ids to campare differences between two commits using git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could
break something?

Because I can just break it and go back to a working state immediately.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For all of my future projects.
