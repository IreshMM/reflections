When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

When collaborating with others on the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

fork is to be used on github to clone a repository to my account,
clone is used to clone a branch (along with all the reachable
commits) to another location and a branch is a label given for a
specific commit (most of the time it is a leaf of the tree made up
of commits)
