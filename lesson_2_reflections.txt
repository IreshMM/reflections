What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
do it?

It initializes the current directory as a git repository. I just
need to be inside some directory with read/write permissions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It gives us the advantage of bundle a set changes that makes a
logical change and then make a commit. It's sort of like a
preview of what is to be commited.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit
per logical change?

Because I can bundle all changes to staging area first and make a
single commit for all of them.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?

When we need to work and keep on multiple versions of repository
simultaneously, when we need to try an experimental change that we
are not sure would work and we can identify commits by human readable
names.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

We can see entire linear history of branches and of course they
branch out.
